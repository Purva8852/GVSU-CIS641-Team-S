Discussion points: 

* Project finalised discussion
    - Plan A - Searching a Product for shopper in nearest store and cheap value
        1. This is very vast project and because of the complexity of design, it will be hard to implement in one semester.
        2. All members are not aware of object recognisation AI technologies.
        3. We need to have all the shops registered and product details updo date which increases complexity. 
    - Plan B - Ride sharing with known people or groups
        1. Pros and cons of both approches are discussed and finalised that application for GVSU stdents which can offer or take a ride will be implemented. 
        2. Slight change in project is disccused - instead of forming groups of known people this can be done only for GVSU students.
        3. Technologies and database requirements are discussed such as React-Native,  AWS cloud services-DynamicDB etc

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* All team members should think about functional and non-functional requirements of project.
