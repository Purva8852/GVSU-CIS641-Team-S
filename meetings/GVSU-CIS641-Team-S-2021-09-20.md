# Meeting Overview

During our first meeting, the team members discuessed potential project topics and came up with two possible topics. Depending on members' research on their capabilities for implementation of necessary technologies, the team will settle with one of the two topics.

## Meeting minutes template

Team name: Team S

Members present: Hyeong Gyu Jang, Srikar Pratap, Sudarshan Venkatesh, Purva Tanmay Shah

Date: 09/20/2021

Time: 17:05 ~ 17:35

Discussion points: 

* Member Background Experiences
    - Hyeong: Experienced in web app development
    - Srikar and Sudarshan: Experienced in web app development--own a fully-functional blockchain web app
    - Purva: Experienced in database queries
* Settled Ideas
    - The team wants to create either web or mobile app that is deployed through AWS platform.
* Potential Topics
    - Plan A: (with higher preference of the team)
        - An app that does the following:
            1. Using the local mobile device's camera app, take a picture of a thing, i.e. a page of a textbook.
            2. Recognize what the object in the picture is.
            3. Search online to see where (physical location or a website) can the user buy the object with competitive price.
            4. Alternatively, the user can just type in the keyword for the object to run the search.
        - This app is useful as it provides convenience in searching a product for a shopper.
    - Plan B: (if Plan A's object recognition exceeds the team's capability)
        - An app that does the following:
            1. A user can sign up to the app and categorize oneself as car-owner or non-car-owner.
            2. A user can add another user as a friend
            3. Friends can share geographic locations so that a car-owning user can offer a ride or a non-car-owning user can ask for a ride to/from his/her friends.
            4. Visualize users' location on a map, possibly using third-party map application API.
        - This app is useful as it provides communication network for ride-sharing among friends, not among strangers, so that it can add on safety advantage over what other commercial ride-sharing apps (i.e. Uber) offer.

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Hyeong/Srikar: research core technologies (map API) that can be implemented for Plan B, and evaluate their viability to be implemented.
* Purva and Sudarshan: research core technologies (object recognition AI) that can be implemented for Plan A, and evaluate their viability to be implemented.
* Finalize the project topic and technology stack as a group.
